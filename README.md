# APPROACH FOR TOPIC MODELLING 
Textrank-LDA


For topic modelling,raw Youtube com- ments were translated into english using Google translation module Google Trans in python . POS tagging was performed on the cleaned text and keywords highly relevant were extracted using TextRank algorithm. Combining TextRank with LDA impoved topic modelling by refining input data making topics relevant to each other and without repetition.
